When I was a kid back in the 80s my parents bought our family's first computer,
a Commodore 64 with a datasette station. I still have fond memories of that
marvelous little machine. At the time though I was only ten years old so my
mental capacity (and likely also patience) was quite limited. I never managed
to do much with it besides playing games and typing in the occasional BASIC
listing from the Sunday newspaper. But that almost never worked anyway.

Now in recent times I often find myself watching retro computing episodes from
the big YouTubers in the field such as [The 8-Bit
Guy](https://www.youtube.com/user/adric22) and [Retro
Recipes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6gARF3ICgaLfs3o2znuqXA). Needless to
say they often feature the C64 and it is refreshing to be reminded of a simpler
time. A time when things were not complicated to absurdity, sometimes
seemingly, just for the sake of it.

While I know that there are numerous C64 emulators available (mostly in
software but also a few FPGA based) I always thought that would be a neat
project to try on.

Some weeks ago I ran across the [C64 on an
FPGA](http://c64onfpga.blogspot.com/) blog series by Johan Steenkamp, a blog
series dating from 2017 to present detailing his journey in implementing an
FPGA based C64 emulator. While I don't agree with every design decision taken
there the work put in to implementing and the effort spent documenting it is
really impressive.

So inspired by this I thought I would try doing something similar or at least
see how much work would be required to get a system that boots into BASIC.

## Preparations

Before we get started it is useful to gather some preliminary materials.

Kernal, basic and character ROMs can be picked up from
[here](http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/firmware/computers/c64/).

## Considerations

By today's standards the C64 is a simply system. However when trying to
reimplement it with modern technology (and methodology) inside a single FPGA
there are a few things that need to be kept in mind.

The design is based around asynchronous RAM so for reading you expect the data
to become available in the same cycle as the address is presented. This is
different from the synchronous RAM blocks found inside FPGAs where an
additional clock cycle must pass before the data is available.

There are no stall cycles or handshake signals in the bus protocol so every
transaction is expected to complete immediately. Also if a chip is not
connected to the bus the writes to that will simply be ignored and reads return
a default value. When trying to bring up the system this is both good and bad.
Good because you feel you make progress fast but bad since you will probably
miss implementing functionality that turned out to be really important to avoid
those hard to find bugs later on.

The CPU and VIC-II share the same bus by allowing the CPU to access during the
first phase of the clock and the VIC-II during the second phase of the clock.
This does not map really well to the single edge methodology used in most
modern designs.

Also as the design is made up of discrete ICs they are connected with a classic
tri-state bus. Tri-state buses inside the fabric is not supported by modern
FPGAs so multiplexers need to be used instead. In a way though, it would be
nice to be able to closely recreate the PCB interconnect inside the FPGA and
have each IC correspond to a Verilog module with the exact same interface
signals.

The VIC-II has a 8Mhz pixel clock but the remaining design is based around a
1Mhz system clock where both phases (or edges) are used. This also complicates
matters and it is always wise to avoid multiple clock domains unless absolutely
necessary.

## Design

So given the considerations in the previous section I have chosen to use a
single clock domain of 8Mhz with enable signals corresponding to the positive
and negative phase of a 1Mhz clock.

The single ported synchronous RAM modules are wrapped so that they act as
asynchronous RAM that can be independently accessed with the two 1Mhz phases
enable signals. See
[rtl/spram.v](https://github.com/markus-zzz/myc64/blob/master/rtl/myc64/spram.v) and
[rtl/sprom.v](https://github.com/markus-zzz/myc64/blob/master/rtl/myc64/sprom.v).

A implementation of a very basic VIC-II is started in
[rtl/vic-ii.v](https://github.com/markus-zzz/myc64/blob/master/rtl/myc64/vic-ii.v)
and likewise for the CIA in
[rtl/cia.v](https://github.com/markus-zzz/myc64/blob/master/rtl/myc64/cia.v).

Everything is wired up and connected to a fake keyboard matrix in
[rtl/myc64-top.v](https://github.com/markus-zzz/myc64/blob/master/rtl/myc64/myc64-top.v).


## Results (so far)

First of all the code for the MyC64 project can be found [here on
github](https://github.com/markus-zzz/myc64) where the README contains a short
intruction sequence to get started with the simulator for those interested.

Simulation is Verilator based and the driver program
[myc64-sim](https://github.com/markus-zzz/myc64/blob/master/sim/myc64-sim.cpp) is
similar to the one used for [my previous RetroCon project]({% post_url
2019-08-12-retro-gaming-hw-part-1 %}) but with the addition of some nifty
features to execute delayed commands at a certain frame (e.g. no point
injecting a key press sequence until the system has finished booting).
```
markus@workstation:~/work/repos/myc64/sim$ ./myc64-sim -h
Usage: ./myc64-sim [OPTIONS]

  --scale=N             -- set pixel scaling
  --frame-rate=N        -- try to produce a new frame every N ms
  --save-frame-from=N   -- dump frames to .png starting from frame #N
  --save-frame-to=N=N   -- dump frames to .png ending with frame #N
  --save-frame-prefix=S -- prefix dump frame files with S
  --exit-after-frame=N  -- exit after frame #N
  --trace               -- create dump.vcd
  --cmd-load-prg=<FRAME>:<PRG>           -- wait until <FRAME> then load <PRG>
  --cmd-inject-keys=<FRAME>:<KEYS>       -- wait until <FRAME> then inject <KEYS>
  --cmd-dump-ram=<FRAME>:<ADDR>:<LENGTH> -- wait until <FRAME> then dump <LENGTH> bytes of RAM starting at <ADDR>
```
As an example consider the following command line that starts simulation and
then waits until video frame #135 before injecting the key sequence for the
classic one-line BASIC maze generator.
```
./myc64-sim --cmd-inject-keys=135:"10<SPACE>PRINT<SPACE>CHR<LSHIFT>4<LSHIFT>8205.5+RND<LSHIFT>81<LSHIFT>9<LSHIFT>9;:GOTO<SPACE>10<RETURN>RUN<RETURN>"
```

It is also possible to inject an arbitrary `.prg` file into memory and run
that. E.g. here we take a trivial program that cycles the background color and
assemble it into a `.prg` file.
```
Start:
loop:  inc $d021
       jmp loop
```
```
cl65 -o test_001.prg -t c64 -C c64-asm.cfg -u __EXEHDR__ testasm/test_001.s
```
It is interesting to note that the `cl65` tool will also insert a small BASIC
header containing the necessary `SYS <addr>` command so that the assembled
program can be started with a simple BASIC `RUN` command.
```
./myc64-sim --cmd-load-prg=130:test_001.prg --cmd-inject-keys=135:"LIST<RETURN>RUN<RETURN>"
```

## Next steps

I am reasonably happy with the result so far given the limited effort put in,
but of course it does not have to end here, this could evolve in any number of
different directions. Here are some ideas that come to mind

* Continue making the implementation more complete and exact, e.g. take a game such as [Bubble Bobble](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Bubble_Bobble) and try to make it play.
* Get it running on the ULX3S. This would require putting the video frame in SDRAM so that HDMI/DVI can read it at the correct refresh rate for 640x480@60Hz. Also here we could find real use for [the usbdev project]({% post_url 2020-05-16-usb-dev-part-2 %}) to allow key and `.prg` injection from a host PC.
* Start looking at a SID implementation.
* Rewrite in [nMigen](https://github.com/m-labs/nmigen). For quite some time now I have been wanting to try out nMigen on a project and this might be a good opportunity.

That is it for this post. If you have questions or feedback - leave a comment below!
