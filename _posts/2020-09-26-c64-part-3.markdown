I figured the natural next step of our MyC64 journey would be to get the
emulator running on a FPGA, or more specifically the ULX3S board. Doing so
requires a few support systems such as keyboard input and visual output to be
in place so let us use this post to look at how that can be accomplished.

## Keyboard input and control

As we already know the real C64 keyboard is a 8x8 matrix connected directly to
the CIA1 and scanned by the KERNAL code. Any modern keyboard we might find is
based on scan-codes so some conversion layer (much like what we already do in
`myc64-sim`) will be necessary.

In addition to keyboard input `.prg` injection also needs to be handled.

A straight forward way to deal with these requirements is to treat the emulator
as a USB device and develop some kind of software on the host workstation that
performs the keyboard forwarding and program injection. Additional control
signaling such as reset/reboot could also be handled this way.

Following this approach would put good use to my [USB
device](https://github.com/markus-zzz/usbdev/tree/dev) implementation detailed
in previous posts as well as serving as motivation for thoroughly finalizing it
and working out remaining bugs.

So let's do that! We simply grab the entire USB device subsystem
[from github](https://github.com/markus-zzz/usbdev/tree/dev) including controlling
RISC-V CPU with ROM and RAM.

On the workstation software side we need to develop a program that communicates
with the USB device while maintaining a workable GUI. For the USB communication
we use [libusb](https://libusb.info/) and for GUI we relay on
[GTK](https://www.gtk.org/). Combining these two essentially boils down to
using the asynchronous API of libusb and plugging it in to the single event
loop handled by GTK.

To be more precise libusb is queried for its (Unix) event file descriptors and
the GTK event loop is setup to watch these (presumably using the select system
call internally). Details are found in
[sw/myc64-keyb.cpp](https://github.com/markus-zzz/myc64/blob/master/sw/myc64-keyb.cpp).

## Video output

Displaying C64 video output in a reasonable way is rather tricky as we need to
comply with both the internal timing of the VIC-II (to avoid compatibility
issues with existing software) as well as the timing of the chosen video format for
a modern display.

Apparently this is not impossible as the [Ultimate
64](https://ultimate64.com/Ultimate-64) manages to tweak the video timing of
576p50 to match its VIC-II output (described
[here](https://1541u-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/hdmi.html)).
Details on the 576p50 video mode can be found
[here](https://ez.analog.com/video/f/q-a/109341/timing-details-of-720x576-progressive-video).

For this project we choose to go a different route and store intermediate
VIC-II video frames in external SDRAM and display them in 640x480@60Hz over
DVI/HDMI.

## Audio output

Not much to say about this. The ULX3S features a 4-bit resistor ladder for DAC
and we simply connect the SID's mono output to it. Actually depending on the
content 4-bit resolution does not sounds as bad as one would think. Just listen
to [this comparison video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nODn5HJGtAY).

## The MyC64 SoC

Combining these systems in a SoC turns out as follows

![MyC64 SoC](/download/c64/myc64-soc.svg)

As can be seen this involves interaction between several clock domains.
Especially the visual path, which is rather intense in terms of pixel
shoveling, uses asynchronous FIFOs when crossing in and out of the SDRAM's
125MHz clock domain.

The ECP5-12F only has two PLLs so we are limited in the number of clock
frequencies that we can synthesize. Two blocks have strict requirements on the
clock frequency. The USB block needs a clock that is a multiple of 1.5MHz and
the DVI/HDMI controller needs a 125MHz clock (and a derived 25MHz pixel clock).
The MyC64 block needs a clock in the neighborhood of 8MHz but it does not have
to be exact (especially now that it is decoupled from the display).

So given these constraints we end up with the three clock domains 15MHz, 25MHz
and 125MHz seen in the diagram. The MyC64 block uses an internal clock enable
to "divide" the 15MHz clock by two.

For the SDRAM the 125MHz clock appears to be a bit too tight, both on the PCB
as well as inside the FPGA (builds often fail timing constraints). So with
additional clocking resources it would be preferable if this clock could be
lowered to say 100MHz.

Since the async FIFOs don't provide *almost full* and *almost empty* signaling
it seemed difficult to operate the SDRAM in burst mode (i.e. as the burst is
pipelined so we need to stop it before the FIFO is full to avoid overrun).
Adding *almost full* and *almost empty* signaling to the FIFO was deemed out of
scope since asynchronous FIFOs are already notoriously complicated in that
area.

One option could have been to add a normal synchronous FIFO in series to get
the *almost full* and  *almost empty* signaling from that FIFO. Another option
could have been to adjust the SDRAM address pointers when an overrun or
underrun occurs (but since timing is already tight in the SDRAM clock domain
this kind of additional logic could make things worse).

While those suggestions seem possible in theory we instead chose a simpler
approach of operating the SDRAM in single access mode. Since the C64 only
generates 16 colors we can store these in SDRAM instead of the full RGB value.
Doing so means that we get four pixels per 16-bit memory access which appears
to fall well within the time budget when operating the SDRAM at 125MHz.

The components used are gathered from various places

* SDRAM controller - Slightly modified version of the one from [fpga4fun.com](https://www.fpga4fun.com/SDRAM.html).
* DVI/HDMI controller - From [Project Trellis DVI](https://github.com/daveshah1/prjtrellis-dvi).
* Asynchronous FIFO - From [here](https://github.com/ZipCPU/website/blob/master/examples/afifo.v). This is a variant of Cliff Cummings design formally verified by Dan Gisselquist. In fact it is the subject of a [Crossing clock domains with an Asynchronous FIFO](https://zipcpu.com/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html) article by Dan.
* MyC64-SubSys - That is what we are working on here.
* UsbDev-SubSys - That is what I was working on before this project.

### Verilator simulation for the SoC

The simulator needed to be extended a bit to handle all the different components
with their associated clock domains. Regrettably I dragged my feet on this and
as a result wasted valuable time trying to diagnose what turned out to be
rather trivial problems while running on the FPGA.

Mostly it is about handling of multiple clock domains in Verilator. Turns out
that Dan Gisselquist has an excellent article titled [Handling multiple clocks
with Verilator ](https://zipcpu.com/blog/2018/09/06/tbclock.html) so I went
ahead and did something similar.

To avoid breaking the video chain we also need to simulate the external SDRAM
so I added a very basic SDRAM model to
[rtl/myc64-soc/myc64-soc-top.v](https://github.com/markus-zzz/myc64/blob/master/rtl/myc64-soc/myc64-soc-top.v).

With all this additional stuff in place simulation with `myc64-soc-sim` is a
much slower than with our previous `myc64-sim`. So much slower that interactive
input and display does not make sense any more. Instead the SoC simulator
stores each video frame directly to the file system in PNG format.

We store video frames directly after the VIC-II output as well as the
intermediate VGA frames that are being fed into the DVI controller. That is we
store output both before and after the error prone SDRAM part.

The SoC simulator `myc64-soc-sim` is implemented in
[sim/myc64-soc-sim.cpp](https://github.com/markus-zzz/myc64/blob/master/sim/myc64-soc-sim.cpp).

### Synthesis

Synthesis for my ULX3S's ECP5-12F FPGA yields the following utilization which I
find rather low given the amount of stuff we have put in. Of course we have
used up all the PLLs and almost all of the block RAM but in terms of logic
slices it is not that high.

As earlier mentioned, the 125MHz clock domain appears to be operating at its
limits as we often get timing constraint violations after small (even
unrelated) modifications to the design.

## Demonstration

After loading the design on the ULX3S board and plugging in the secondary USB
connector we should expect to see the following in `dmesg`

```
usb 1-5: new low-speed USB device number 6 using xhci_hcd
usb 1-5: New USB device found, idVendor=abc0, idProduct=0064, bcdDevice= 1.00
usb 1-5: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
usb 1-5: Product: MyC64 - FPGA based Commodore 64 emulator as a USB device
usb 1-5: Manufacturer: Markus Lavin (https://www.zzzconsulting.se/)
usb 1-5: SerialNumber: 0123456789abcdef
```
At this point the device should be generating DVI/HDMI output and it is
advisable to connect a screen to verify. If all looks good we can go ahead and
connect with `myc64-keyb` and start typing in some BASIC commands. Any key
press (and release) that goes into the application window will be forwarded to
the USB connected MyC64 emulator.

The `myc64-keyb` program takes an optional argument that specifies a `.prg`
file to inject into emulator memory.

An interesting program to try out is the machine language monitor SuperMon by
[Jim Butterfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Butterfield). SuperMon is
the monitor used in Jim's classic book [Machine Language for the
Commodore](https://archive.org/details/Machine_Language_for_the_Commodore_Revised_and_Expanded_Edition).
To get hold of SuperMon itself in modern times simply go to [Supermon+64
V1.2](https://github.com/jblang/supermon64). There one can also find a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEjnMt_3wkU) demonstrating its
capabilities.

## Known issues / Bugs
* USB device loses sync (and host aborts after tree packets with no response) so longer transfers often fail. Works with retry though.
* "Static noise" moves past the screen occasionally (seems to be dependent on when reset is released). Believed to be limitations of SDRAM (traces on PCB) operating at 125MHz.
* Sometimes the `.prg` appears to get corrupted when loaded over USB.
