# Hello and welcome! 

My name is Markus Lavin and by profession I am a software engineer, one who is
located and active in the very south of Sweden. I intend to use this space to
advertise myself as an independent consultant under the flag of my own one man
company *ZZZ-Consulting*. 

For me the most efficient way to do this, I imagine, is to simply write about
things I have done in the past. During the years I have spent numerous hours on
various side projects and instead of having them rot away in a private
repository I plan to publish them here (in parts or whole) accompanied with
some hopefully interesting commentary.

Experience and interest wise I am limited to the following fields which also
happen to be what I plan to write about.

- Compiler engineering
- Graphics and game programming
- Embedded computing
