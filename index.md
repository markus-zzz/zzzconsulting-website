# Hello and welcome!

My name is Markus Lavin and I am a software engineer who is located and active
in the very south of Sweden. I intend to use this site to publish occasional
blog posts relating to the following fields:

- Compiler engineering
- Graphics and game programming
- Embedded computing

The reasoning behind this effort is a combination of self promotion (hopefully)
and keeping an open notebook for myself that additionally may be to the benefit
of others.
