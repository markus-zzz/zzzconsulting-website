# Hello and welcome!

My name is Markus Lavin and by profession I am a software engineer, one who is
located and active in the very south of Sweden. I intend to use this space to
advertise myself as an independent consultant under the flag of my one man
company *ZZZ-Consulting*.

For me the most efficient way to do this, I imagine, is to simply write about
things I have done in the past. Over the years, besides being employed, I have
spent numerous hours on various side projects and instead of having them rot
away in private repositories I plan to publish them here (in parts or whole)
accompanied with some hopefully interesting commentary.

Experience and interest wise I am limited to the following fields which also
happen to be what I plan to write about.

- Compiler engineering
- Graphics and game programming
- Embedded computing

If you want to hire me to do any of those things then I am available locally in
the Lund/Malmo region of Sweden and remotely anywhere. Send a mail to info
address below and we will work something out!
