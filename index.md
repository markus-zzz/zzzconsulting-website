# Hello and welcome!

My name is Markus Lavin and I am a software engineer who is located and active
in the very south of Sweden. I originally intended to use this site to market
myself as a consultant but that ambition has since long been put on the shelf.
Instead I now use this platform to write blog posts about various projects that
I work on.

The reasoning behind this effort is a combination of self promotion (hopefully)
as well as keeping an open notebook for myself that additionally may be to the
benefit of others.
