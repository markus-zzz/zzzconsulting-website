This is a collection of hyperlinks to stuff that I find interesting. Either I
have looked at it in the past or I plan to look at it in the near future.
Putting the links here seems a more permanent and accessible alternative
compared to my current browser's bookmarks menu.

* [Robert Baruch's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBcljXmuXPok9kT_VGA3adg) - Many interesting projects, especially implementing a 6800 CPU with nMigen ([playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEeZWGE3PwbbjxV7_XnPSR7ouLR2zjktw)). He also has a more generic nMigen tutorial [on github](https://github.com/RobertBaruch/nmigen-tutorial).

* [Clocking of VLSI Systems](http://eia.udg.es/~forest/VLSI/lect.07.pdf) - Lecture notes from VLSI course. Provides a good description of two phase clocking schemes. In fact the entire course seems interesting and all the lecture notes are found [here](http://eia.udg.es/~forest/transpes_vlsi.html).
