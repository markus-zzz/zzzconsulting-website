The task of register allocation is probably the most important optimization any
compiler performs and unfortunately also one of the most complex ones. Some
years ago there was a lot of interest in SSA based register allocation
techniques since it would seem that the SSA form allows for a more straight
forward treatment of the problem.

Some fewer years ago I read this article (not sure if it was ever published but
anyway here is a copy) about the implementation of a SSA based register
allocator.  Later on I then went ahead and implemented a version of it in my
own very basic prototype compiler. Doing so led to some interesting insights
(they were for me at least) that I am going to try to write down here in this
post.

Let us start by introducing our running example for this post.

diamond and a loop should be enough right?

if there are no constraints whatsoever.

but there always are.

it is all about the register file permutations.
